# Team Project - D.3 Analysis

## System Description
**Everyone** faces the problem of having to <ins>organize</ins> their **shopping list** in a way to remember every single *item* needed. This leads to *items* being forgotten, unnecessary purchases, and extra grocery trips, wasting time, effort, and money. For anyone, such as *young adults and college students* trying to <ins>budget</ins> their shopping for groceries, **MyGroceryAssistant** is a planning and budgetization app that uses their shopping habits as data to identify prices from multiple stores, and thus informing them of the best possible price and product. Unlike other similar products, our product <ins>finds</ins> the real-time *prices* of **store** *products*, rather than a price that accounts for the service being used. Using an interactive **calendar**, **MyGroceryAssistant** helps young adults remember when and what to <ins>buy</ins> from the **store** while offering other intuitive features that cannot be found with other products. 

As a **user**, **you** can <ins>input</ins> which items **you** buy at the **store**, what price **you** bought them for, and where **you** bought them. From here, **MyGroceryAssistant** will <ins>generate</ins> a **calendar** and **portfolio** for **you** that <ins>shows</ins> when **you** will need to restock on your common *items* and where to get them for the best possible price. This is done through a *price comparison feature* built into **the app**, that <ins>scans</ins> nearby **stores** for their *inventory and prices* in order to <ins>find</ins> **you** the best overall priced list using a *store locator*. **The app** offers a **notification system** that is fully customizable for anything from *texts*, *emails*, *push*, etc. **You** can <ins>change and customize</ins> your **calendar** and **portfolio** at any time using our intuitive and simplistic user interface. **The Portfolio** will also have multiple sorting options using our **sorting algorithm** such as by *price*, *name*, and *location*. Additionally, **the app** will use a *season tracker* to <ins>find</ins> items such as produce, holiday items, specials, etc and <ins>recommend</ins> items based on the season as well as other items to **you**. This will all be done with portability, flexibility, and reliability in mind. Perfomance will be important in order to make your shopping trips as efficient as possible. Finally, using an *email* and *password*, all of the *data* **you** use is <ins>stored</ins> and **encrypted** into our **database**. With all of these features packed into our product, it will be truly set apart from the competition.
