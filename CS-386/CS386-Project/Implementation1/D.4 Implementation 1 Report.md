# Introduction

MyGroceryHelper is a free, simple, and organized way to help you manage shopping and budget with no headaches. The main features of the software are a calendar that events can be manually entered in or events can appear automatically according to your shopping habits, and a clear portfolio to show what you buy weekly.

# Tests

 The testing for this iteration was focused on making sure the UI looked and performed clean.
 Currently automated testing has not been implemented, but we have thoroughly tested the app's implemented features which can be seen in the Demo below.

# Adopted Technologies

The technologies used for this project were:

* **Android Studio IDE:** The best possible option for Android application development. The IDE uses Java and C/C++ and includes many tools, libraries, and features to provide the best possible mobile application development experience. 

* **Android Studio UI Developer:** One of the many tools available in Android Studio. It allows realtime displays of the user interface during development, allowing the developer to make changes on the fly while observing their changes in realtime. It also has many sliders and options to set for the user interface. 

* **Android Studio Device Emulator:** Another tool in Android Studio, allowing developers to run an emulated Android device to run the application and test all functionality and features from the computer. 

* **AWS S3 Buckets:** This technology was used to host our database files. It allows for a secure login for users to access files they need.

# Learning/Training

The team spent time both together and separately researching the best options for technologies. Once we all agreed on the IDE, UI designer, and other technologies, we spent time watching videos, reading articles, and experimenting with them to learn them as best as possible. This included some of the cited sources that we linked in the Readme. 

# Deployment
For deployment of our login system we chose to use AWS S3 buckets to host our database files. The program first makes sure the username is unique and not already registered. The program also makes sure the password is atleast 1 character long. And finally the login system can log in an existing user with its designated password.

# Licensing

For the licensing, we chose the GNU GPLv3 license. This was because it allowed some freedom for people to use our project as they like, while protecting our closed source code files. This means that we can provide the community code while protecting what makes our product unique and valuable. We have added the LICENSE file to the main directory to reflect this choice. 

# Readme File

Readme file attached to the main page of Implementation. 

# Look & Feel

We went for a simplistic design to the User Interface. Some of the user stories said that a simpler U.I is better than a complicated one. As such, our U.I is simple - basically just tabbed fragments with different elements on each. We wanted the U.I to be easy to see what everything does, rather than need a “How To Use” starting video or something of the like.

# Lessons Learned

What we learned is that we need to do better with time management. We are planning on getting more stuff implemented between each other for the second release, and adding some other features (like a search bar for the Product List).

# Demo

The demo displays the various aspects of the application. They are in a prototype state and still need much work, but they give the general idea of how it will work.
