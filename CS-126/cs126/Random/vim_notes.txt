Vim is modal
	vim has different modes for different tasks 
	normal mode is for keyboard commands (ESC)
	ex mode is for typed commands with 'long' names 
	insert mode is for inserting characters (i)
	visual mode (SHIFT + v, CTRL + v, v)

	switching modes switches what the keys do.
	
Vim has combinable commands:
	motion commands and action commands can be combined
	for example, in normal mode, 'd' is the action command to delete 
	combine it with a motion to delete from point to the end of the motion

Some commands:
	Motion:
		h, j, k, l - are like arrow keys
		w and b - move forward and backward by words
		0 and $ - move to the beginning or end of a line

	Actions:
		d - delete with a motion or another 'd' to get the whole line
		c - same as 'd' but enter insert mode afterward
		x - deletes the character under (in front of) point
		p - pastes whatever was most recently deleted after point
		P - pastes at point

	Ex commands: 
		type a colon in normal mode and then a name
		:e <path_to_file> - edit file at the specified path
		:w - save changes to file
		:q - quit
